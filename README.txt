This is a replica of a real life coffee machine program. A user has different choices of coffee to select from and based on the available ingredients and amount of money
the user enters, the coffee will or will not be prepared.

The secret word to end the program is if the user enters "off"
The secret word to display the available coffee ingredients is if the user enters "report"

It is a fun and interactive program to play around with, so kindly give it a try.
